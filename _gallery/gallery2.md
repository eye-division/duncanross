title: New Work
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp;A small selection of new pieces is available now.<br>Each group of forms
  receives a complex surface treatment, sometimes in combination, producing a
  different feel to the piece each time they are fired. These then suggest how
  the piece should be treated in it’s final carbon saggar firing.<br>Each carbon
  firing produces individual results of course and while these pieces have all
  been completed very recently there is notable variation in colour and the way
  the carbon has penetrated the surface.


  Click the thumbnails for details of each piece.
